## Description

This course provides an overview of information assurance and security by exposing students to wide variety of assurance and cybersecurity topics.  The topics will include basic information security terminology, security models, authentication, database security, transmission security, security controls, security policy, security countermeasures, application security and the current threat landscape.  Emphasis will be placed on taking a holistic approach to information security and the interplay of people, process and technology to achieve a positive security posture.  The course will include several case studies to provide students an opportunity for critical thinking and insight into real-world security decisions in the context of a commercial enterprise.

### Prerequisites:

Students are expected to have taken and passed the following courses (or equivalent) with a grade of at least C-: 

* Computer Science 311, 311H, 313H, or 313K 
* Computer Science 307, 314, 314H, 315 or 315H 
* Computer Science 310, 310H, 429 or 429H
* Mathematics 408C, 408K or 408N

### Topics to be covered will include:

* Fundamentals of Information Security
* Security Models
* Authentication and Authorization Systems
* Security Policies and Planning
* Security Countermeasures
* Cryptography  
* Application Security
* Security Metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
* Transmission and Database Security
* The Current Threat Landscape

### Learning Objectives:

Students who successfully complete this course will:

* Understand key security principles, threats and attack techniques
* Understand network and operating system security fundamentals
* Understand authentication and access controls and the theoretical models for them
* Understand security countermeasures and their proper use
* Understand the basic requirements for developing and implementing an information security program
* Understand the differences and implications of perimeter and layered security approaches
* Be able to create a good set of information security metrics
* Assess the role of policy and planning in the success of an information assurance program

### Course Projects:

* Students will work on multiple hands-on labs to demonstrate working knowledge of the security concepts covered by lectures
* Students will complete an exercise to create a security plan for a fictitious commercial entity by allocating budgets and providing written justification the decisions behind their final plan.
