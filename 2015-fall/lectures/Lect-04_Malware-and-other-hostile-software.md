% CS 361 - Intro to Computer Security

# Malware

- Malicious software
- Can you provide some examples?
- Pretty broad category of software

# Malware

- Added to system usually without consent 
- Impacts CIA triad of the victim's system
- Impacts network, OS, application or data
- Destroy, disrupt or just annoy the user

# Malware Key Concepts

- Propagation
- How does it spread?
- Payloads
- What action(s) does it take?

# Malwware Types

- Worm
- Runs independently and attempts to copy then run copies on other systems
- Copy is generally over network
- Typically utilizes an unpatched vulnerability

# Malware Types

- Rootkit 
- Program(s) used after root-level access has been gained to
- hide and maintain root-level access
- Can also be used to hide other running binaries

# Malware Types

- Virus
- Program which replicates itself into other binaries after its 1st run
- When legit program is run, virus executes also
- After infection, other malware can be added or run

# Malware Types

- Macro Virus
- A virus that uses scripting or other embedded code to perform as a virus
- Code runs when document is opened, edited, viewed
- Code can infect other files of the same type

# Malware Types

- Logic Bomb
- Code which is inserted/hidden in a program for later execution
- Code is dormant until a condition triggers its execution
- Triggers and execution attacks can vary widely

# Malware Types

- Trojan Horse
- A legit looking program which also holds malicious code
- While user runs legit function, malicious code also runs
- Code attempts to hide while legit use assists propagation

# Malware Types

- Backdoor
- Code which allows unauthorized access by bypassing normal security checks
- Allows access to app or underlying OS
- Sometimes put in for emergency or debug access

# Malware Types

- Adware
- Software designed to push unwanted advertisements to a system
- Can generate multiple pop-up windows during browsing
- Can redirect browser to a specific site

# Malware Types

- Drive-by-download
- Code which uses browser vulnerabilities to download additional malware
- Victim only needs to view a page with an unpatched browser
- Downloaded malware types are wide ranging

# Malware Types

- Ransomware
- Code which encrypts or otherwise makes unusable files on a system
- Generally targets user-created files
- Encryption key can be purchased to 'unlock' files

# Malware Types

- Downloaders
- Code designed to bring other malware onto a system 
- Generally run as part of or immediately after initial infection
- Allows for initial code to stay small and have diverse effects

# Malware Types

- Exploits
- Code which targets a specific vulnerability
- Can be used to modify system files, gain elevated privileges, install malware
- Sometimes bundled or downloaded to keep malware persistent

# Malware Types

- Attack kit
- Programs/tools to generate new malware automatically
- Can chain multiple propagation or exploitation software together
- Can obfuscate code to bypass detection 

# Malware Types

- Mobile Code
- Malware which uses scripting, macros or other portable code
- Desire is for malware run on multiple platforms / OS versions
- Same code execution across platforms

# Malware Types

- Auto-rooter / Script Kiddie
- Automated tools to remotely compromise systems over the network
- Utilize unpatched vulnerabilities or misconfigurations
- Low technical sophistication

# Malware Types

- Keylogger
- Software to capture and record all keystokes on a system
- Used to capture credentials or other valuable information
- Keystrokes can be stored locally or over network

# Malware Types

- Flooders aka DOS tool/client
- Used to generate large volumes of network traffic at a target
- Usually syn floods to DOS/DDOS a target
- LOIC is an example used by Anonymous for Hacktivism

# Malware Types

- Spammer programs
- Software to send out large volumes of email/SPAM from victim's computer
- Run on client systems 
- Utilize Web App vulnerability to infect server to send out SPAM

# Malware Types

- Bot / Zombie
- Software on an infected system used to launch other code
- Bot herder activates bots to run chosen attacks/malware
- Used to attack other systems and obscure attacker source

# Categorizing Malware

- Attackers don't play by the rules
- Mix and match types to fit their needs
- Attempt to make malware live longer

# Blended Attacks

- Mixing and matching multiple methods...
- of infection/attack by using multiple exploits
- AND propagation to spread more quickly

# Crimeware

- A name for malware used to conduct specific crimes
- e.g. Malware focused on gaining bank credentials or attack a specific bank
- Hierarchy of criminal from code writers, re-sellers, those who execute the attack
- Entire underground economy exists to support malware/crimeware

# Hacktivism

- Using malware and other offensive techniques for a cause
- Usually part of a protest movement
- Borrow tools/techniques from crimeware but use for social causes

# Parts of Malware

- Infection mechanism
- Exploit/infection vector malware uses for infection and propagation
- Trigger
- The condition or event that activates the malware's payload
- Payload
- The intended function of the malware besides spreading e.g. keylogging

# Phases of Malware

- Dormant Phase
- Malware is idle and not executing.  Not all malware has a dormant phase
- Propagation Phase
- Malware copies itself into other programs or to disk to persist
- Malware may change/modify itself per copy to defeat detection
- Triggering Phase
- Malware code is activated to preform its intended function/attack
- Execution Phase
- The actual malware function is performed e.g. send SPAM, DDOS attack, ...

# Virus targets

- Boot sector: infect master boot record/boot record to spread during system startup
- File infector: infects files or other system executables
- Macro virus: infects files with scripting code run by an application e.g. MS Word
- Multipartite virus: infects multiple file types and/or infects in multiple ways

# Hiding Malware 

- Encrypted code
- A portion of executable is encrypted and key stored in malware. 
- During execution, code is decrypted and run
- Encryption changes the binary 'look' of the code to conceal its intent

# Hiding Malware

- Stealth code
- Multiple techniques are combined to hide code from detection esp from anti-virus software
- Entire virus is hidden via (multiple) compression, code mutation / obfuscation
- Small 'shim' program knows how to start unraveling the malware

# Hiding Malware

- Polymorphic Malware
- Portion of malware changes on every copy/propagation
- Use to defeat signature-based detection techniques
- Lots of libraries exist to create different binaries

# Hiding Malware

- Metamorphic Malware
- Entire code of malware changes with every copy/propagation
- Rewrite is complete making detection significantly harder
- Behavior may also change - not just binary code 

# Hiding Malware

- Phishing
- Exploit trust in legit looking email/website to get malware installed
- Spear Phishing
- A very targeted attack usually involving significant recon work before sending
